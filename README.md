Projects on networking protocols and network automation

Accessing web pages and mobile applications has become a common practice in the modern world. The objective of this project is to make enterprise/business people take leverage of webpage UI to do network modification using Network automation. Even though there are many ways to remotely connect to a network system like putty, SSH Client, only a professional engineer can take full advantage. This project allows small businesses to access and monitor their network architecture. Integration of developed Webpage UI and multiple python executable files for each instance for switch and router will help anyone to easily access, read and modify the network device configuration.

Network automation uses Python library like Netmiko, Napalm and uses Ansible for accessing all the device configurations at once. Its an angentless methodology that completely works on PUSH method. This methodology helps in immediate remote execution. On the other hand, a webpage with GUI incorporate python script file to do the task. Script file will push out the configuration through encrypted connection to the network device. The response will be shown to the user. As an advanced option, device modification and security measures can be directly changed from the user end. This will provide absolute control of their own network system.

In future, this can be combined with machine learning to learn business needs and change GUI accordingly.
